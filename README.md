== New Morning ==

SaaS-less reboot of Morning Roll: http://tombubul.info/morningroll.html

An ongoing learning project. :)

== To-do ==

In no particular order.

- [X] "Hello World"-level CRUD
- [ ] Render server response messages
- [ ] Sum, avg, and large roll counts by playername
- [ ] Basic roll validation; 1 roll per name per date.
- [ ] Temporary undo with trust-based validation ("delete your last roll if you've already submitted one and if it's within the last few minutes")
- [ ] Basic table pagination at 50 or 100 records
- [ ] Row-by-row record edit/delete (for admin purposes); make it so editing in mongo is never required
- [ ] Mongoose model
- [ ] Basic form validation
